# Project Description 
## The Data
We are going to be using a public data source on dog registration in New York City, which contains information related to dog's such as names, ages, breeds, etc. and we will be able to analyze all of these variables in different ways.

[NYC Dog Licensing Dataset](https://public.enigma.com/datasets/nyc-dog-licensing-dataset-2016/3729f91b-f340-467e-9170-4078de389d24)

This data is collected through the DOHMH Dog Licensing System in New York City, where residents are required by law to register their dogs with the city government. We are going to be accessing it through Public.Enigma which provides us with either API access or a downloadable .csv file. 

## The Audience 
Our audience is intended to be dog lovers in general, because we think this data will reveal a lot of interesting things about the popularity of certain dog breeds, names, etc. as well as possibly revealing trends in names/breeds that are trending either towards being more popular or less popular. 

We think our audience would be interested in reading about: 
* What is the most popular name for dogs in 2018?
* What is the most popular breed of dog in 2018? 
* What is a common name for older dogs that isn't as popular with younger dogs? 
* What breeds of dogs seem to live the longest? 
* Do certain names correlate with certain breeds?
* We could also ask these same questions but with the added variable of gender

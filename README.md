## Data
We used a public data source on dog registration in New York City, which contains information related to dogs such as names, ages, breeds, etc. and we have analyzed all of these variables in many different ways.

[NYC Dog Licensing Dataset](https://public.enigma.com/datasets/nyc-dog-licensing-dataset-2016/3729f91b-f340-467e-9170-4078de389d24)

This data is collected through the DOHMH Dog Licensing System in New York City, where residents are required by law to register their dogs with the city government. We accessed it through Enigma Public which provided us with a downloadable .csv file. 

## Audience 
Our audience is intended to be dog lovers in general, because this data reveals a lot of interesting things about the popularity of certain dog breeds, names, etc. as well as revealing trends in names/breeds that are trending either towards being more popular or less popular.

We think our audience would be interested in reading about: 
* What were the top dog names and breeds overall? How did they change over time?
* How do the top names and breeds vary based on gender and age categories?
* Based on breeds, what are the top names, distribution of age, and distribution of borough of residence?
